# Slang Playground Examples

This is an unofficial collection of assorted samples written in the [Slang Shading Language](https://shader-slang.org/) that are intended to run directly in the [Slang Playground](https://shader-slang.org/slang-playground/).

If you open this repository with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), install the [Slang Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shader-slang.slang-language-extension) to run and interact with these samples directly in your editor, even while offline.
