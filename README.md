# Slang Playground Examples

This is an unofficial collection of assorted samples written in the [Slang Shading Language](https://shader-slang.org/) that are intended to run directly in the [Slang Playground](https://shader-slang.org/slang-playground/).

If you open this repository with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), install the [Slang Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shader-slang.slang-language-extension) to run and interact with these samples directly in your editor, even while offline.

## Samples

### Alan's Abstract "Art"

You have to click and drag the mouse all around before this one really gets going.

### Alan's Sandbox

Sand, Air, Plant, Fire, and Water, in a sandbox. Sand and water fall in air. Sand sinks in water. Plants grow in water. Fire burns plants. Paint your scene with the mouse.

### IQ's Better Voronoi Edges

The amazing Inigo Quilez demonstrates (originally on Shadertoy) how to calculate Voronoi cells without degenerate edges, by calculating the edge distance.
